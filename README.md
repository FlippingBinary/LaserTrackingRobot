# LaserTrackingRobot
This was a simple laser tracking robot written in Python 2.7 and used to entertain people as they explored the booths at WVSU Day at the Capitol 2017.

The code is designed to run on a Raspberry Pi 3, and no documentation is being provided at this time because this repository is currently intended to archive the code for future reference.
